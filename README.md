# dotfiles
My .files (OS X) with help from mathiasbynens and many other places.

###_THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS_

1. Install oh-my-zsh
2. Install NVM
3. Install RVM
4. Install Homebrew
final. run `./install_dotfiles` from here to symlink all dotfiles. Watch for files that already exist, as they won't be overridden.
finalb. run `./install_osx_settings` and then reboot. _Ignore for now_

Manual Installs:
* ~/.gitconfig (contains private token)


TODO:
* set src files to open with bash syntax highlighting
* keep a list of npm -g somewhere
* integrate brew.sh
* quicklook extensions
* automate manual installs?
* sublime text and atom configs
* finish osx script (set hot-corners, )
